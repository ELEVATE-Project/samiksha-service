# Docker Setup Samiksha Service - With Project (Windows)

Expectation: By diligently following the outlined steps, you will successfully establish a fully operational Samiksha application setup, including both the portal and backend services.

## Prerequisites

To set up the Samiksha application, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. For Windows users, detailed installation instructions for both can be found in the documentation here: [How To Install and Use Docker Compose on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/). To install and use Nodejs in Window machine, you can follow instructions here: [How To Install Nodejs in Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

## Installation

**Create samiksha Directory:** Establish a directory titled **samiksha**.

> Example Command: `mkdir samiksha && cd samiksha/`

> Note: All commands are run from the samiksha directory.

## Checking Port Availability 

> **Caution:** Before proceeding, please ensure that the ports given here are available and open. It is essential to verify their availability prior to moving forward. You can run below command in your terminal to check this

```
for %p in (3001 3002 6000 5001 4000 9092 5432 7007 2181 27017 3569 4301) do @(
  netstat -ano | findstr /R /C:":%p " /C:":%p$" >nul
  if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Port %p is available
  ) else (
    echo Port %p is IN USE
  )
)
```

1.  **Download Docker Compose File:** Retrieve the **[docker-compose-samiksha.yml](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/raw/main/documentation/1.0.0/dockerized/docker-compose-samiksha.yml)** file from the samiksha service repository and save it to the samiksha directory.

    ```
    curl -OJL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/dockerFiles/project-with-survey/docker-compose-project.yml
    ```

    > Note: All commands are run from the samiksha directory.

2.  **Download Environment Files**: Using the OS specific commands given below, download environment files for all the services.

   ```
   curl -L ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/interface_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/entity_management_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/project_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/notification_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/scheduler_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/user_env ^
    -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/envs/samiksha_env
   ```

> **Note:** Modify the environment files as necessary for your deployment using any text editor, ensuring that the values are appropriate for your environment. The default values provided in the current files are functional and serve as a good starting point. Refer to the sample env files provided at the [Samiksha](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/blob/main/.env.sample), [User](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/user/blob/master/src/.env.sample), [Notification](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/notification/blob/master/src/.env.sample), [Scheduler](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/scheduler/blob/master/src/.env.sample), [Interface](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/interface-service/blob/main/src/.env.sample) and [Entity-management](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/entity-management/blob/main/src/.env.sample) repositories for reference.

> **Caution:** While the default values in the downloaded environment files enable the Samiksha Application to operate, certain features may not function correctly or could be impaired unless the adopter-specific environment variables are properly configured.

3.  **Download `docker-compose-up` & `docker-compose-down` Script Files**

   ```
   curl -OJL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/project-with-survey/windows/docker-compose-up.bat
   ```
   ```
   curl -OJL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/project-with-survey/windows/docker-compose-down.bat
   ```

4.  **Download `Config` File**

   ```
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/common-files/generics/configFile.json -o config.json
   ```


5.  **Run All Services & Dependencies**:All services and dependencies can be started using the `docker-compose-up` script file.

   ```
   docker-compose-up.bat
   ```

> Double-click the file or run the above command from the terminal.

> **Note**: During the first Docker Compose run, the database, migration seeder files, and the script to set the default organization will be executed automatically.

6.  **Remove All Service & Dependency Containers**:
    All docker containers can be stopped and removed by using the `docker-compose-down` file.
    
   ```
   docker-compose-down.bat
   ```

> **Caution**: As per the default configuration in the `docker-compose-samiksha.yml` file, using the `down` command will lead to data loss since the database container does not persist data. To persist data across `down` commands and subsequent container removals, refer to the "Persistence of Database Data in Docker Containers" section of this documentation.

## Enable Citus Extension (Optional)

User management service comes with this bundle relies on PostgreSQL as its core database system. To boost performance and scalability, users can opt to enable the Citus extension. This transforms PostgreSQL into a distributed database, spreading data across multiple nodes to handle large datasets more efficiently as demand grows.

For more information, refer **[Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com/)**.

To enable the Citus extension for user services, follow these steps.

1. Create a sub-directory named `user` and download `distributionColumns.sql` into it.
    ```
    mkdir user && curl -o ./user/distributionColumns.sql -JL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/distribution-columns/user/distributionColumns.sql
    ```
2. Set up the citus_setup file by following the steps given below.

   1. Download the `citus_setup.bat` file.
      ```
      curl -OJL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/stand-alone/windows/citus_setup.bat
      ```
   2. Enable Citus and set distribution columns for `user` database by running the `citus_setup.bat`with the following arguments.
      ```
      citus_setup.bat user postgres://postgres:postgres@citus_master:5432/user
      ```
      > **Note:** Since the `citus_setup.bat` file requires arguments, it must be run from a terminal.

## Update Cloud Credentials for Samiksha Service

To enable full functionality—including certificate generation, attachment uploads, and report storage—you must configure cloud credentials in the environment files for both services.

A. Samiksha Service Configuration Path:
    ```./samiksha_env
    ```

B. Samiksha (Survey & Observation) Service Configuration Path:
    ```./samiksha_env
    ```

Add or update the following variables in the .env file, substituting the example values with your actual cloud credentials:

    CLOUD_STORAGE_PROVIDER=gcloud
    CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCOUNTNAME=your_account_name
    CLOUD_STORAGE_SECRET="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
    CLOUD_STORAGE_SAMIKSHA=your_cloud_samiksha_id
    CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKETNAME=your_bucket_name
    CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_TYPE=private

> NOTE : This service is designed to support multiple cloud storage providers and offers flexible cloud integration capabilities. Based on your selected cloud provider, the service can be configured accordingly to enable seamless storage, certificate generation, and report handling.

For detailed configuration options, supported cloud providers, and integration guidelines, please refer to the official documentation available in this [ReadMe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-cloud-services?activeTab=readme)

## Persistence Of Database Data In Docker Container (Optional)

To ensure the persistence of database data when running `docker compose down`, it is necessary to modify the `docker-compose-samiksha.yml` file according to the steps given below:

1. **Modification Of The `docker-compose-samiksha.yml` File:**

    Begin by opening the `docker-compose-samiksha.yml` file. Locate the section pertaining to the Citus and mongo container and proceed to uncomment the volume specification. This action is demonstrated in the snippet provided below:

    ```yaml
    mongo:
    image: 'mongo:4.4.14'
    restart: 'always'
    ports:
        - '27017:27017'
    networks:
        - samiksha_net
    volumes:
        - mongo-data:/data/db
    logging:
        driver: none

    citus:
        image: citusdata/citus:11.2.0
        container_name: 'citus_master'
        ports:
            - 5432:5432
        volumes:
            - citus-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```

2. **Uncommenting Volume Names Under The Volumes Section:**

    Next, navigate to the volumes section of the file and proceed to uncomment the volume names as illustrated in the subsequent snippet:

    ```yaml
    networks:
        elevate_net:
            external: false

    volumes:
        citus-data:
        mongo-data:
    ```

By implementing these adjustments, the configuration ensures that when the `docker-compose down` command is executed, the database data is securely stored within the specified volumes. Consequently, this data will be retained and remain accessible, even after the containers are terminated and subsequently reinstated using the `docker-compose up` command.

## Sample User Accounts Generation

During the initial setup of Samiksha services with the default configuration, you may encounter issues creating new accounts through the regular SignUp flow on the Samiksha portal. This typically occurs because the default SignUp process includes OTP verification to prevent abuse. Until the notification service is configured correctly to send actual emails, you will not be able to create new accounts.

In such cases, you can generate sample user accounts using the steps below. This allows you to explore the Samiksha services and portal immediately after setup.

> **Warning:** Use this generator only immediately after the initial system setup and before any normal user accounts are created through the portal. It should not be used under any circumstances thereafter.
  1. **Download The `sampleData.sql` Files:**

      ```
      mkdir sample-data\user 2>nul & ^
      curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/project-with-survey/windows/sampleData.sql" -o sample-data\user\sampleData.sql
      ```

2. **Download The `insert_sample_data` Script File:**

   ```
   curl -L -o insert_sample_data.bat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/stand-alone/windows/sampleData.sql
   ```

3. **Run The `insert_sample_data` Script File:**

   ```
   insert_sample_data.bat user postgres://postgres:postgres@citus_master:5432/user
   ```

    After successfully running the script mentioned above, the following user accounts will be created and available for login:

    | Email ID               | Password   | Role                    |
    | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
    | mallanagouda@gmail.com | Password1@ | State Education Officer |
    | prajwal@gmail.com      | Password1@ | State Education Officer |
    | vishnu@gmail.com       | Password1@ | State Education Officer |


## Sample Data Creation For Projects and Samiksha

This step will guide us in implementing a sample project and Samiksha solution following the initial setup of the Samiksha service.

1. **Insert Sample Data To Database:**

   1. Download `insert_project_data.bat` Script File:

      ```
      curl -L ^
      -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/refs/heads/main/documentation/3.4.0/dockerized/scripts/stand-alone/windows/insert_project_data.bat
      ```

    2. Make the setup file executable by running the following command.

       ```
       insert_samiksha_data.bat
       ```
    3. Insert Sample Data To Database.

       ```
       node insert_sample_solutions.js
       ```

## 🌐 Micro-Frontend (FE) Setup

The ELEVATE application uses a micro-frontend architecture. After setting up the backend services, you must configure and run the frontend repositories to access the application via the portal.

Follow the setup guides for the frontend repositories:

-   **Login Portal:** [elevate-portal](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/elevate-portal/tree/releaase-1.1.0)
-   **Projects Program Module (PWA):** [observation-survey-projects-pwa](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/observation-survey-projects-pwa/tree/release-3.4.0)

> **Warning:** In this setup, features such as **Sign-Up, Project Certificate, Project Sharing, and Project PDF Report** will not be available because cloud storage credentials have been masked in the environment files for security reasons.
