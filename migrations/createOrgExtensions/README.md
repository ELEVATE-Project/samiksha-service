# Tenant Organization Migration Script

This Node.js script performs a migration for organizations across tenants. It checks the health of dependent services, fetches tenants and their organizations, verifies existing organization extensions in MongoDB, and pushes Kafka events for new organizations.

---

## Features

1. **Service Health Check**: Ensures that required services (`Survey Service` and `User Service`) are healthy before running the migration.
2. **Tenant Fetching**: Retrieves tenant codes either from the command-line or the User Service API.
3. **Organization Fetching**: Retrieves organizations for each tenant from the User Service API.
4. **MongoDB Check**: Identifies existing organization extensions in MongoDB to avoid duplicate Kafka events.
5. **Kafka Event Push**: Sends messages to a Kafka topic for newly added organizations.
6. **Interactive Error Handling**: Prompts the user to continue if fetching an organization list fails.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- MongoDB connection
- Kafka broker
- `.env` file containing all required environment variables

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URL=<MongoDB connection URL>
DB=<MongoDB database name>
KAFKA_URL=<Kafka broker URL>
ORG_UPDATES_TOPIC=<Kafka topic name>
USER_SERVICE_URL=<User Service base URL>
INTERFACE_SERVICE_URL=<Interface Service base URL>

## Running the Script with a Specific Tenant

You can run the script for a specific tenant by providing the tenant code via the Node.js command line. This overrides fetching all tenants from the User Service API.

```bash
node createOrgExtensions.js --tenant=<tenant_code>
