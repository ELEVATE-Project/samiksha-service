    This API collection serves the Survey Service, covering both Observations
    and Surveys. It provides various endpoints for managing and interacting with
    surveys and observations, along with comprehensive report generation
    functionalities.


    Observations:

    - Observations with Rubric: Allows assessment based on predefined rubrics.

    - Observations without Rubric: Flexible observations without structured
    rubrics.

    - Reports: Survey Reports: Generate detailed reports based on survey
    submissions.

    - Observation Reports: Includes:
      - Entity Reports: Focuses on specific entities being observed.
      - Instance Reports: Provides detailed information on specific instances of observation.
    - PDF Reports: Available for both entity and instance reports.

        The Upload Criteria API allows users to upload a CSV file containing
        information about the criteria used to observe or evaluate an entity.
        Each record in the CSV should include a criteriaId, criteriaName, type,
        and other relevant information. The API processes this file, validates
        the data, and stores the criteria details in the system for further use
        in reports and evaluations.

         The Upload Framework API allows users to upload a CSV file containing observation data, along with a framework in JSON format. The framework sheet should include an external_id (UUID) for each framework entry, and the criteria external_id generated during the criteria upload process must also be included.

        This API is used to create solutions based on a framework upload. Users
        must provide a frameworkID (UUID) and specify the entityType as defined
        in the template.

            Every request to the API requires an x-auth-token in the header for
            authentication. This token is generated when a user logs in and must
            be included in each subsequent request to verify the user’s session
            and permissions.

        The Observation Submission API is used to submit answers to a
        questionnaire for a specific observation. By providing the
        observation_id and the corresponding answers, this API updates the
        answers in the database.



        Request Parameters:

        observation_id (required): The ID of the observation for which answers
        are being submitted.

        answers (required): A collection of answers corresponding to the
        questionnaire questions. This should be structured according to the
        format specified in the questionnaire.

        This API retrieves a sharing link for a survey solution using the
        solutionExternalId provided in the path parameters. The returned link
        allows users to access or share the survey solution, enabling easy
        distribution or collaboration. This is particularly useful for sharing
        surveys with external participants or stakeholders.

        This API maps a survey solution, identified by solutionId, to a specific
        program. The programId should be passed in the query parameters
        (req.query.programId), which represents the external ID of the program.
        Once mapped, the solution will be associated with the designated
        program, allowing for its usage within the context of that program.

        This API verifies the validity of an observation link provided as :link
        in the path parameters. It checks whether the link is active and valid,
        and returns relevant details associated with the observation if the
        verification is successful. This can be used to ensure that users are
        accessing a legitimate observation link before proceeding with further
        actions.
